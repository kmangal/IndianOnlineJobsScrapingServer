## Installation
This code is designed to run on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance. After booting the instance from scratch, run util/startup.sh to get the environment set up. I set up a test environment on my laptop within Anaconda. `conda install m2-base` allows me to access linux commands within my Anaconda environment.


## Notes
* Aasan jobs changed its name to Waah Jobs.
